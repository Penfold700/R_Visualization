   a. Basic Scatter Plot \
   b. Scatter Plot with feature differentiation by color & shape \
   c. Scatter Plot with feature differentiation by size & transparency

### 2. Line Plot
   a. Basic Line Plot \
   b. Line Plot with feature differentiation by color

### 3. Bar Plot
   a. Basic Bar Plot \
   b. Basic Bar Plot Polar Transformation \
   c. Stacked Bar Plot \
